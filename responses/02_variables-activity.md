## Step 3: Define variables based on the instruction in TODO
Let's create a few variables using golang

### :keyboard: Activity: Create variables based on the TODO comment
1. In `src/02_variables/main.go`, complete the TODO around lines 6, 9, 10. You can print out the value with `fmt.Println(variabe_name)` to check the result
2. Save the file
3. Stage, commit and push your changes to `changes` branch
    ```
    git add src/02_variables/main.go
    git commit -m "Create variables"
    git push
    ```

I will respond you once you commits have been pushed.
